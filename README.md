Welcome to the most amazing bookmark manager EVER!. It is built using [Angular 2](https://angular.io) and the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/), along with demonstrating the following concepts:

* A robust build system thanks to the Angular CLI
* Best practices in app structure
* Component-driven architecture
* Routing
* Server communication
* Unit testing

## Prerequisites
You must have [Node v4+ and NPM v3+](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Getting started
Run the following in your terminal:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/simpulton/eggly-angular2.git
cd eggly-angular2
npm i
npm start
```
The app will be available on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and will automatically reload when files are changed.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build, and use the `-aot` flag to enable ahead-of-time compilation.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
